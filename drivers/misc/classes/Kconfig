config GPIOCLASS
      tristate "GPIO class"
      ---help---
	  This is a set of classes for general purpose io ports.
	  These devices typically contain a data register, 
	  which holds the current state of the pins, and a ddr register, 
	  which sets the pin to input or output, 0 or 1 respectively 

config GPIOCLASS_SYSFS
	depends on SYSFS && GPIOCLASS
        bool "sysfs interface"
        ---help---
	  Enables a sysfs interface to the gpio class

        ---help---
	  Enables a Xenomai RTDM interface to the gpio class

	depends on GPIOCLASS
	bool "char interface"
	---help---
	  Enables a character device interface to the GPIO class.

config PWMCLASS
        bool "PWM class"
        ---help---
	  This is a set of classes for pulse width modulation.
	  It allows the creation of pwm classes which can be configured
	  through sysfs. PWM devices typically contain a 
	  duty and frequency configuration register.

	  enables a Xenomai RTDM interface to the pwm class	  
	  
config SPICLASS
        tristate "SPI class"
        ---help---
	  This is a set of classes for SPI interfaces.
	  It allows the creation of spi classes which can be configured
	  through sysfs. SPI devices typically contain a 
	  speed and flags register, a method for locking the bus, 
	  and a bidirectional "xmit" method.

config SPICLASS_SYSFS
	depends on SYSFS && SPICLASS
        bool "sysfs interface"
        ---help---
	  Enables a sysfs interface to the spi class

config SPICLASS_CHAR
	depends on SPICLASS
	bool "char interface"
	---help---
	  Enables a character device interface to the spi class.

config SPICLASS_RTDM 
	depends on XENO_SKIN_RTDM && SPICLASS
        bool "rtdm interface"
        ---help---
	  Enables a Xenomai RTDM interface to the SPI class.

config AD7766_RTDM
	depends on XENO_SKIN_RTDM && SPICLASS_RTDM
	bool "AD7766 ADC RTDM Interface"
	---help---
	  Enables access to AD7766 using RTDM SPI.

config FPGA_RTDM
	depends on XENO_SKIN_RTDM
	bool "FPGA RTDM Interface"
	---help---
	  Enables access to FPGA using an iomap.


config LSI2ESC
        depends on SPICLASS && SPI_MASTER
        tristate "Linux SPI Interface to EMAC SPI Class interface"
        ---help---
          Enables a generic interface between the Linux SPI
          driver and the EMAC SPI Class. Boards with an SPI controller
          driver can use this to define generic access to a device
          through the EMAC SPI class.

config LSI2ESC_AD7766
        depends on LSI2ESC && GPIOCLASS
        bool "AD7766 ADC GPIO Interface"
        ---help---
          Enables an extension to the LSI2ESC to allow use of the SPI-based
          AD7766 ADC through the GPIO Class. 

config LSI2ESC_ADS1158
        depends on LSI2ESC && GPIOCLASS
        bool "ADS1158 ADC GPIO Interface"
        ---help---
          Enables an extension to the LSI2ESC to allow use of the SPI-based
          ADS1158 ADC through the GPIO Class.

	depends on LSI2ESC && GPIOCLASS
	bool "MCP3208 ADC GPIO Interface"
	---help---
	  Enables an extension to the LSI2ESC to allow use of the SPI-based
	  MCP3208 ADC through the GPIO Class. The LSI2ESC interface for this
	  device must first be setup and registered in the board specific 
	  initialization code followed by a call to the class creation 
	  function in this driver.

config LSI2ESC_MCP4922
	depends on LSI2ESC && GPIOCLASS
	bool "MCP4922 DAC GPIO Interface"
	---help---
	  Enables an extension to the LSI2ESC to allow use of the SPI-based
	  MCP4922 DAC through the GPIO Class. The LSI2ESC interface for this
	  device must first be setup and registered in the board specific 
	  initialization code followed by a call to the class creation
